## Workspace

The workspace tab is where you add, remove and manage your projects and files.

Here a few things you can try:
- Open a page in the preview by either double clicking on a `.html` file or draging it to the preview tab.
- Simply pin a file to edit it by either double clicking on it (except for html files), draging it to a new (or existing) code tab or right click on it and choose "Pin in code tab"
- Right click on the project, directory and files to see all what you can do

As soon as you're ready, you should (create a new project](#create-a-project).
You can also remove the sample project to clear your workspace by right clicking on the project and click on "Delete project".
