## Code

A code tab is automatically added to the left pane when opening files from the workspace, navigating in the preview or selecting an element.

A code tab can have several files pined in it.

- Blue files are local ones and can be edited
- Orange files are remote ones. For now they can't be edited

Here a few things you can do with files:
- Click to fold / unfold the code editor in accordion mode
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+Click to fold / unfold keeping other code editors opened
- Drag and drop to the left unpin the code editor
- Drag and drop up and down to sort files in the pane
- Drag to another tab to pin the file in another tab
