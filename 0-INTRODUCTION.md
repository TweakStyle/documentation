### What is TweakStyle

TweakStyle is an [Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) for Web Development.
Unlike most IDEs, TweakStyle is tailor-made for Front-End Development and understands Web Design.
It packs all you need to code, preview and debug Web interfaces with a smart and friendly interface.

### Why TweakStyle

It first started with a daily frustration. I was developing the front end of a web app and with the tools I had, the development process was really painful. I was switching all day long between tools that didn't integrate well with each other (code editor, build tools, browser & development tools) and was taking a ridiculously long time to make small adjustments.
__Our usual workflow is highly splitted, inefficient and unconfortable__.
__TweakStyle steps up your workflow to the next level__ by letting you preview and test as you code in a breeze.

### What TweakStyle is Not

TweakStyle is not a Content Management System.
TweakStyle is not a Visual Editor.

TweakStyle purpose is to __Code__.
Even if it ships a preview and visual tools, It still requires knowledge about Web Development to be used.
