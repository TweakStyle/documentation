### What is TweakStyle

TweakStyle is an [Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) for Web Development.
Unlike most IDEs, TweakStyle is tailor-made for Front-end Development and understands Web Design.
It tends to packs all you need to code, preview and debug Web interfaces with the perfect blend of features.

### Why TweakStyle

_“It first started with a daily frustration. I was developing the front end of a web app and with the tools I had, the development process was really painful. I was switching all day long between tools that didn't integrate well with each other (code editor, build tools, browser & development tools) and was taking a ridiculously long time to make small adjustments.”_, Félicien François, Creator of TweakStyle

__Our usual workflow was heavily splitted, inefficient and unconfortable__.
__TweakStyle steps up your workflow to the next level__ by letting you preview and test as you code in a breeze.

### What TweakStyle is Not

TweakStyle is __not a Content Management System__, even if it can be used to edit web contents.
TweakStyle is __not a Visual Editor__, even if it packs some visual tools.

TweakStyle is definitely __made to Code__.
As a result it requires a minimum knowledge of Web Development to be used.

### System requirements

Operating System:
- Mac OS X 10.9+ 64bit
- Windows 7+ (ARM version of Windows is not supported for now)
