## Introduction

Welcome to the [TweakStyle](https://tweakstyle.com) documentation. This is a __work in progress__ and will be continuously updated. Pull requests are welcome so if you would like to contribute, please [fork me on GitHub](https://github.com/TweakStyle/documentation). {notice}

### What is TweakStyle

TweakStyle is an [Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) for Web Development.
Unlike most IDEs, TweakStyle is tailor-made for Front-end Development and understands Web Design.
It tends to packs all you need to code, preview and debug Web interfaces with the perfect blend of features.

### Why TweakStyle

_“It first started with a daily frustration. I was developing the front end of a web app and with the tools I had, the development process was really painful. I was switching all day long between tools that didn't integrate well with each other (code editor, build tools, browser & development tools) and was taking a ridiculously long time to make small adjustments.”_, Félicien François, Creator of TweakStyle

__Our usual workflow was heavily splitted, inefficient and unconfortable__.
__TweakStyle steps up your workflow to the next level__ by letting you preview and test as you code in a breeze.

### What TweakStyle is Not

TweakStyle is __not a Content Management System__, even if it can be used to edit web contents.
TweakStyle is __not a Visual Editor__, even if it packs some visual tools.

TweakStyle is definitely __made to Code__.
As a result it requires a minimum knowledge of Web Development to be used.

### System requirements

Operating System:
- Mac OS X 10.8+ 64bit
- Windows 7+ (ARM version of Windows is not supported for now)
- Linux (Verified to work on Ubuntu 12.04 and later, Fedora 21 and Debian 8)

Hardware requirements:
- 2GB of RAM
- 125MB of available hard-disk space
- 1280x800 display with 16-bit video card

### Development status & Roadmap

TweakStyle is currently in __active development__.
The currently available release is flagged as __Beta__.
It means it is stable enough to be used daily by everyone but there are still some works in progress.
Some features are not yet shipped and others need to be improved.

On top of bugs fixing and general improvements, the plan for 2016 is:
- Project focused work
  - Single project view
  - Quick switch between projects
  - Per project settings (stored in a per project metadata file)
  - Project templates
- Panes Splitting
  - Support Dual screen setups (undock preview)
  - New split mode (with ability to move pane over another)
  - Undock workspace tab
- Embedded Help
  - Embedded Demo
  - Contextual Help bubbles (Togglable)
  - Sample projects
- Advanced CSS Preprocessor support (SASS/LESS/Stylus)
  - Embed compiler binaries
  - Dedicated build settings dialog
  - Live update preview while typing for SASS/LESS/Stylus
  - Guess build commands from sourcemaps
- More Information & Control
  - File, request and mapping information bubbles
  - Rework settings and add more configurability
  - More commands on code editors
  - Improved Override and Build tools dialogs
- Various Fixes and Additions from [Users feedback](https://feedback.userreport.com/4c0a2f4d-0129-4a8c-88f3-cbbf6052f814/)

The timeline and priorities may vary depending on the result of our experiments, on users feedback and on our available time and resources.
