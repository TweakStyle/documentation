Documentation is wrote in Markdown (`.md` files).
The following markdown extension are enabled and can be used:
- commonmark, gfm, html, breaks, linkify, table of contents, highlightjs
- [Footnote](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-footnote)
- [ImSize](https://github.com/tatsy/markdown-it-imsize)
- [Attrs](https://github.com/arve0/markdown-it-attrs)

To build markdown files into the final HTML, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), then execute `npm install` at the root of the project.

## TODO

Here a not exhaustive list of what remains to do:
- Add screenshots and videos
- Add a part about Settings
- List available commands and hotkeys
