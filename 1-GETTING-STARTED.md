## Getting Started

TweakStyle UI is splitted in 2 panes.
When opening TweakStyle, you'll see the Workspace tab on the left side and the Preview pane on the right side.
When you'll open files for editing or when you'll navigate in the preview pane, code files will be pined in new tabs, on the left side.

When first opening TweakStyle, a sample project is added to your [Workspace](#workspace) to let you make tests without having to [Create a project](#create-a-project).
